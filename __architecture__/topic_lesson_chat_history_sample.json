Understand basic list comprehension syntax\n2. Apply conditional filtering in list comprehensions\n3. Work with nested list comprehensions\n\n**How the Lesson Works:**\n- I'll ask you a series of questions, starting with basic concepts\n- Each question builds on previous knowledge\n- You can ask for clarification or adjust difficulty at any time\n- We'll use multiple-choice and coding exercises\n\nThe current difficulty is set to **High School** level. Would you like to adjust this or are you ready to begin?"

Let me break down why this is correct:\n\n```python\nrange(3)        → [0, 1, 2]    # The input sequence\nx*2             → Multiply each by 2\n[x*2 for x...] → [0, 2, 4]    # The final result\n```\n\nI particularly like how you showed your step-by-step reasoning.
